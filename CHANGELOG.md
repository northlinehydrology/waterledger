# Changelog

Package changes (code). Changes to the numbers are listed by model version on the Water Ledger methods page.

## 2.0.0 (Oct 29, 2026)

The 2.0 API, per [design 0001](docs/design/0001-schema-and-api.md). Model version 1.2; numbers unchanged.

- **New front door** in `waterledger`: `wl.place()`, `Place`, `Context` (jurisdiction, supply, wastewater, receiving,
  climate, energy), `DataCenter`, `Site`, `site.estimate()` returning an `Estimate`, and `site.to_bmi_config()`. All are
  validated pydantic models that round-trip through JSON. Michigan is available; other states come through the national
  tier in 2.x.
- **States as folders** (`waterledger.states.<st>`), each with a builder and a provider; Michigan's builder moved to
  `states/mi/build.py`, and existing imports still work.
- **Published data:** without a local site, Michigan's published data files are downloaded and cached.
- **Models** (`waterledger-models`): one physics module; xarray ensembles with dask; lake-source ensembles; CSDMS BMI 2.0
  components checked by `bmi-tester` in CI; STAC publishing; an Open-Meteo weather loader. Optional installs:
  `[ensemble]`, `[bmi]`, `[stac]`, `[all]`.
- **Versions decoupled:** package versions follow semver; `MODEL_VERSION` tracks the numbers.

## 0.1.x and 1.2.x (Oct 29, 2026)

First releases: the models, public data ingest and Michigan builder moved out of Northline's engine.
